## About the project

This is a photo portfolio and once it will be terminated it will host all my photos divided into galleries.

The original idea is building a format for photographers who want to create their own portfolio. Once created an admin account they will be able to create/delete galleries and to upload/delete images. No account needed to visualize the galleries.
